# Tic Tac Toe Plain
A plain JS, single file tic tac toe implementation. This was created as part of my studies of International Computing and Media (with minor improvements post submit). 
Gotta get that formal degree somehow for stuff I've been doing for years. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

## Features
- Over-engineered game logic :hammer_and_wrench:
